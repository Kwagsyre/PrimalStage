# Primal Stage
Primal Stage is a early game mod with focus on making the world a bit harder. It adds requirement to use an axe for wood mining, change mob drops and adds some primitive mechanisms such as primitive grill for cooking, kiln for ore smelting, drying rack and cutting log. All mechanisms are made interactive without GUI. Besides this adds bushes, stone pebbles and twigs laying on the ground for more immersive in the game. It also adds some decoration blocks like shelfs, fences and hedges for all wood types.
